This git repository contains all the Supplementary files, scripts used, results obtained in the MTP project "scRNAseq Analysis of AML CD34+/CD38- population with Diagnosis and Relapse paired data" by Joseba Elizazu.

Supplemental figures are already in the `Supp Material` directory, and the scripts used in the `Scripts` folder. Shortly all figures in the MTP will also be uploaded, together with other results generated but not included in the project.
