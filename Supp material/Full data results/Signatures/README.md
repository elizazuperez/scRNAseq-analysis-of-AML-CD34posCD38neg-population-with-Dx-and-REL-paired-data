2. The WikiPathways **Aerobic Glycolysis**,
3. The Reactome pathway **Glycolysis**, 
4. The GO term **G0 to G1 transition**, 
5. The KEGG pathway **Drug Metabolism - Other Enzymes** (*KEGG: Drug Metabolism* in the plot), 
6. The GO term **DNA Damage Response Signal Transduction by P53 Class Mediator Resulting in Cell Cycle Arrest** (*GO: p53 DNA dam. resp.* in the plot)
