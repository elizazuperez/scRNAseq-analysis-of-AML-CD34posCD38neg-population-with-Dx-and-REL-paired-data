## `Dx vs REL ORA`: **Supp. files 6** 
One of the problems arisen in this project: the ORA performed (REL vs ORA) in all cells in the data and the performed within all the selected clusters (clusters 5, 7, 10, 12) have similar results.  
* `Enrichment allDX vs allREL.xlsx`: Dx vs REL ORA result in all cells of the data
* `Cluster X allDx vs allREL.xlsx`: ORA results in the three databases in X cluster comparing REL vs Dx cells
* `Cluster X allDx vs allREL.pdf`: Dotplots of the 5 most enriched terms from the analysis of the previous file
