# ORA results from sample data
This directory contains the **Supp files 2**, consisting of a different directory for each sample with:
* `enrichment.xlsx`: The ORA results from the three databases (GO, KEGG, Reactome) on an excel file. Top 100 DEG genes in each cluster were used.
* `enrichment normal.pdf`: A pdf file with a dotplot generated with *enrichplot* on each page, showing the 5 most significantly enriched pathways per cluster.
