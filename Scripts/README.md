# Scripts

This directory contains all R markdown scripts used in the MTP "scRNAseq Analysis of AML CD34+/CD38- population with Diagnosis and Relapse paired data".

Note that these are not meant to be knitted, and that the code will be tidied up on the following days.

* `Whole_Integration.Rmd` file was used to perform the full data integration, not for analysis or figure export.
* `Veltencolors.Rmd` was created to assign to each projected cell type a randomly generated color to be used throughout the project.
* `Analysis.Rmd` is created for the analysis of the full data integration.
* `Figures.Rmd` was used to create most plots and figures to be included in the TPM from sample data and patient paired data
